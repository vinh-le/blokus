<h1>Blokus Help</h1>

<h3>Goal:</h3> 
	<p>Blokus begins with either an empty 20 x 20 grid (4-player game) or a 14 x 14 grid (2-player game). Each player is assigned a color and receives 21 uniquely shaped pieces with varying sizes,
	from one to five squares. The goal is to be able to play the most pieces possible without getting blocked by other players.</p>
	</br>
<h3>Game Play:</h3>
	<p>Players take turns playing individual pieces onto the board. On the first turn, a player must play a piece that touches a 
	"starting square" marked by a circle. Placement of "starting squares" depends on the amoutn of palyers in the game.
 	Subsequent pieces can only be played by having corner-to-corner contact with same-color pieces.
	Edge-to-edge contact is only allowed for different colors. Players can “block” other players by placing a piece that covers
	the corners of another player’s piece. When a player has been completely blocked and sees no viable moves they may withdraw using
	their concede square in the bottom left hand area of the grid. Gameplay continues until all players have withdrawn from the game.</p>
	</br>
<h3>Scoring:</h3>
	<p>At the end of the game, scores are calculated based on the number of tiles on the grid that each player has covered
	with their pieces. The player with the most points wins.</p>
	</br>
<h3>Controls:</h3>
	<p>Gameplay will take place on the board, which is defined by the black borders. Players will take turns placing their
	pieces by using the mouse to select an anchor square of a desired piece on the right side, and then placing it on a location within the board.
	Pressing the SPACE bar will rotate the piece 90 degrees once a piece has been initially selected.</p>
